So what is Scorchy?

Scorchy is a thick (opposed to "thin" Silverlight&trade; version) graphical user interface for System Center Orchestrator 2012 R2&reg; by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).
### Key features
- Able to execute runbooks against multiple sets of data (allows execution of repeatable tasks)
- Able to copy-paste from all of the fields
- Allows to search for particular runbook by simply typing it's name
- Able to show who executed particular runbook, and when. Uses ADDS domain controller to resolve SIDs to logon names

I've developed it with intention to ease monotonous work for people who execute some runbooks multiple times (e.g. Helpdesk staff using some runbooks to execute some script with elevated privileges).

Here's some screenshots:
